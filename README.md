# Breath-Alcohol-Tests-in-Ames-Analysis 

### Project Description
Using data collected from the State of Iowa, you will group, summarize, and visualize data on breath alcohol tests in Ames, Iowa, (home of Iowa State University) from 2013-2017. Some questions you will answer include, "What is the highest recorded value?" and "When do breath alcohol tests occur most?"

### Guided Project
Use your data manipulation skills to explore breath alcohol test data and answer such questions as the most common month of the year for breathalyzer tests!
